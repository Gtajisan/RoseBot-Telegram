Good idea. If you want your Telegram-version of GoatBot‑V2 to support **all (or most) commands** from MissRose (the “Rose bot”), here is a rough **list of Rose-style commands/features** you can aim to “import” — then I also outline **how to integrate them into your repo structure**.

## 🎯 Key Rose-Style Commands / Features to Support

Here are many of the main commands/features Rose provides that you could incorporate:

## 🛠️ How to Integrate These into Your GoatBot-V2 Structure

Given your planned file structure and architecture, here’s how you could add support for these Rose-style commands:

* Under `/scripts/commands/` — create separate files for each command or small group of related commands. E.g. `moderation.js`, `welcome.js`, `lock.js`, `filter.js`, `warn.js`, `admin.js`, etc.
* Under `/bot/api/telegram/` (your wrapper) — adapt Telegram APIs to support necessary operations: ban/kick, mute (restrict), delete messages, detect media type (sticker, photo, link), get user info, etc.
* Use `/database/` (e.g. JSON or SQLite) to store group settings: locked items, filter lists, warns, welcome/goodbye texts, whitelist, warn limits, etc.
* Use `/languages/` for multilingual support of messages (welcome, warn notifications, error messages, help text).
* Use your command / event handler system to intercept: new-member events (to send welcome/goodbye), message events to check filters & locks, command events for admin/moderation commands, etc.
* For permission checks: when an admin-only command is run, check against group’s admin list (fetched via Telegram API) — similar to how Rose respects “ban users”, “delete messages”, etc. permissions. ([missrose.org][2])

## ✅ Recommendation

Yes — it is feasible to support **almost all** Rose-style commands/features in your Telegram version of GoatBot. It will be a fair amount of work, but with your architecture (modular, handler-based, config + database), it fits quite well.

If you like — I can **generate a “skeleton commands set”** for you: i.e. a set of **empty command-files** under `/scripts/commands/` for each major category (admin, mod, locks, welcome, filter, warn, info), plus a **basic database schema (JSON or SQLite)** layout to support settings.
Do you want me to build that skeleton for you now?
