I have a GoatBot-V2 bot in Node.js with commands from Rose Bot and Baka-Chan-v1, including AI/Image commands like edit.js. I want you to:

Fix all deployment errors for Render platform:

Resolve Node.js version issues

Ensure environment variables (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, MONGODB_URI, BOT_PREFIX, BOT_ADMIN_ID) are loaded correctly from Render secrets

Fix file path issues (absolute vs relative)

Ensure package.json has all required dependencies (telegraf, axios, express, lowdb/mongodb)

Ensure bot keeps running in Render environment

Add global error handling for unhandled rejections and uncaught exceptions

Convert all commands to Telegram API:

Replace Messenger API calls with ctx.reply(), ctx.replyWithPhoto(), ctx.telegram.editMessageText(), etc.

AI/Image commands: check reply_to_message.photo, pick largest photo, send loading message (⏳), send final edited image, handle errors gracefully

Include all Rose Bot commands:

Moderation, admin, welcome/goodbye, locks/filters, notes, warn system, utilities

Include all Baka-Chan commands:

AI/Image, fun commands, anime, group tools

Build a dashboard like GoatBot:

Express-based web dashboard

Telegram OAuth login

Show bot stats, connected groups, and command usage

Allow managing group settings: welcome messages, prefix, locks, filters

Include REST API endpoints for commands

Deployable on Render alongside the bot

Command loader & error handling:

Load all commands from /scripts/cmds automatically

Validate commands have config and onStart

Skip invalid files with warnings

Catch and log errors without crashing

Testing & final deployment:

Test all command categories in a Telegram group

Test AI/Image commands with replies

Test dashboard functionality and REST API

Ensure all errors are fixed for smooth deployment on Render

Output:

A fully production-ready Telegram GoatBot-V2 with dashboard

All commands (Rose + Baka-Chan) adapted to Telegram

Error-free and fully deployable on Render

The bot must run immediately on Render using the environment variables and dashboard fully functional.
