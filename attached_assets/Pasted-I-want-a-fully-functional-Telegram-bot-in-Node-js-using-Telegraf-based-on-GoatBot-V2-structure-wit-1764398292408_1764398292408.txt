I want a fully functional Telegram bot in Node.js using Telegraf, based on GoatBot-V2 structure, with all commands from Rose Bot and Baka-Chan-v1, including AI/Image commands like edit.js. The bot should use SQLite for database storage (like GoatBot), instead of MongoDB or lowdb, and be deployable on Render or Replit.

Requirements:
1. SQLite Support

Use sqlite3 or better-sqlite3 for database

Database schema should store:

Users (ID, role, warnings)

Groups (ID, prefix, welcome/goodbye messages, locks/filters)

Command usage/cooldowns

Notes/Auto-reply filters

Replace any MongoDB or lowdb usage with SQLite

Ensure async-safe queries

2. Telegram API Adaptation

Replace Messenger API calls with Telegram API (ctx.reply(), ctx.replyWithPhoto(), ctx.telegram.editMessageText())

AI/Image commands: support reply_to_message.photo, pick largest photo, show loading ⏳, send final image, handle errors

Command loader auto-detects all /scripts/cmds/* commands

Validate commands have config and onStart, skip invalid files

3. Include All Commands

Rose Bot: moderation, admin, welcome/goodbye, locks/filters, notes, warn system, utilities

Baka-Chan: AI/Image, fun, anime, group tools

4. Dashboard (Like GoatBot)

Express-based dashboard

Telegram OAuth login

Show bot stats, connected groups, command usage

Manage group settings: prefix, welcome messages, locks/filters

REST API for commands

Fully functional on Render

5. Render Deployment Fixes

Node.js version compatible with Render

Environment variables: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, BOT_PREFIX, BOT_ADMIN_ID

Ensure SQLite file works in Render environment

Global error handling for unhandled rejections and uncaught exceptions

Logs visible in console

6. Testing & Auto-Fix

Scan all commands for syntax errors, missing await, invalid Telegram API usage

Auto-fix common issues

Ensure AI/Image commands, fun commands, and moderation commands work

Ensure SQLite queries run correctly in production

7. Output

Fully working Telegram GoatBot-V2 with SQLite support

All commands (Rose + Baka-Chan) converted to Telegram

Fully tested, error-free, and Render-deployable

Dashboard fully functional and connected to SQLite database
